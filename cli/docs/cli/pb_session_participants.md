## pb session participants

Show terminal sharing and connected participants

### Synopsis

Show terminal sharing and connected participants

Show current participants and sharing grants for one session. Use this to review access before removing a teammate or ending sharing.

Terminal sessions persist independently of a single connection and can be reattached after a disconnect. Sharing grants explicit access to a named session. Closing, deleting, and removing a participant have different effects; inspect the selected session before acting.

JSON output is supported with --json.

```
pb session participants <session-id> [flags]
