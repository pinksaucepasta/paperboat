## pb team create

Create a team

### Synopsis

Create a team

Create a named team with this account as its initial owner. Membership and resource grants are managed separately after creation.

Teams use explicit membership and resource grants. Membership alone does not grant machine use, ENV values, previews, or tunnels. Mutations use the current team generation to reject stale edits; read pb team get before retrying a conflicting change.

JSON output is supported with --json.

```
pb team create <team> [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for create
      --json   print canonical JSON
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --config string      path to the CLI config file
      --no-customization   ignore local shortcuts, command defaults, and TUI preferences
      --server string      paperboat-server base URL override
      --workspace string   resource workspace selector: personal or a team slug
```
