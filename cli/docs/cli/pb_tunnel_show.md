## pb tunnel show

Show a durable tunnel

### Synopsis

Show a durable tunnel

Show one durable tunnel's configured identity, routes, domains, and control state. Use status for current health and logs for event history.

Durable tunnels retain identity, routes, connectors, and domains across client sessions. Ephemeral tunnels have a separate lifecycle. Route publication and browser HTTP access require exact authorization; TLS for browser HTTP terminates at the edge.

JSON output is supported with --json.

```
pb tunnel show <tunnel> [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for show
      --json   print canonical JSON
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --config string      path to the CLI config file
      --ephemeral          use the temporary preview lifecycle
      --no-customization   ignore local shortcuts, command defaults, and TUI preferences
      --server string      paperboat-server base URL override
```
