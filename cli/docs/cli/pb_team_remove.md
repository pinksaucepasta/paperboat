## pb team remove

Remove a team member

### Synopsis

Remove a team member

Remove one member from a team at the expected generation. Team resource access supplied through membership is withdrawn for that account.

Teams use explicit membership and resource grants. Membership alone does not grant machine use, ENV values, previews, or tunnels. Mutations use the current team generation to reject stale edits; read pb team get before retrying a conflicting change.

JSON output is supported with --json.

```
pb team remove <team> <account> [flags]
```

### Options

```
      --generation uint   expected current team generation
  -h, --help              help for remove
      --json              print canonical JSON
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --config string      path to the CLI config file
      --no-customization   ignore local shortcuts, command defaults, and TUI preferences
      --server string      paperboat-server base URL override
      --workspace string   resource workspace selector: personal or a team slug
```
